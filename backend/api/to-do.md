here's what i want,


currently i have a file called tasks.py thats really long it just the job but it does it poorly i need to fix this and quickly.

so right now i can extract audio and put it into a video  but the issue is the the lyrics arent sync and it they dont like i want to so i want to change the approach 


right now the video has lyrics but the lyrics go one fram aftere the aother for example 

breathe in air - next second - dont be afirad to care 

i dont want it too look like that 

they should going down  like this 
breathe in the air 
dont be afaird to care 

sort of an animation so users can follow the lyrcis carefully. this is my vision but i need to do a simplier way 

theres deepgram API to pull in audio and transcribe it in real time. right i have the audio coming from local files so we need to figure out that. we need to figure a new approach. for this your going to have to understand how @task.py works
